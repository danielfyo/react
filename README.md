## 1. Why React
Concepts introduced by react
- Dont't touch the , I will do it!
- Declarative vs Imperative

### 1.1 Before react

At first jQuery allowed developers to easyly interact with the DOM (Documetn Object Model).

It had a unify easy way to access the element and modify them indepently of the web browser.

Backbone.js allowed us to organize those masive and big files.

Ajax allowed to work with web apps similar than desktop applications rendering small pieces insted redirect to a new page all the time.

AngularJS helped us with all those concepts working with components, but problems appreared because a lot of components interact and generate a lot of events and bug became hard to find.

Facebook came up with the solution, in 2013 they released react to the developer comunity [React Repo](https://github.com/facebook/react).

They developed a new way to do the things.

The new principles react introduced made it what it is today.
